# Machine-Learning-Based-Path-Planning

The objective of this project is to perform indoor localisation of a turtlebot with the help of a camera using Real Time Object Detection (RTOD). RTOD is a much better option than conventional localisation outdoor since GPS isnt as effective indoors and other approaches like LiFi, RSSI etc arent as efficient. 

Current Version - Melodic and Ubuntu 18.04

Enter the following commands:
> Set Turtlebot 3 model:   

    bash
    export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL="waffle"
    
    
> Launch file:

    bash
    roslaunch bot_description start.launch
